# On The Road
Explore the world through someone else's eye

##About the project
The project is built on AsyncDisplayKit. I don't have time to finish the all app. Main features are finished. You can create a new channel, post a photo, and explore some landmarks. User login and core location are not yet implemented.

As Bobby found a kind of bug about the CPU and memory leak, I found it's caused by the large image downloading. If the size of the image is about 1~2 MB or even larger, the app will crash without generating any crash logs. So I scaled the image and save it on the Parse.com now. Let me know if it still cause. Thanks.

I use Cocoapod to organzie the third party library. Open RoadTrip.xcworkspace to run the project.
